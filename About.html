					<h2>About FabLab</h2>
					<p>On our first lesson, we were taught on the safety rules and regulation about the lab and
					getting to know the different types of machines that we are going to be using.</p>
					
					<p>Attire wise, we have to be in proper attire when entering the lab, wearing long pants, 
				        covered shoes and hair to be cut short for guys and to be tied up for girls.<p>
					
					<p>Failure to do so, you are not allowed into the lab as it may prevent injuries or maybe even 
				        death. Our lecturer, Mr Steven, even shared some incidents that happened in the past<p>
