	  <p>We were taught on how do develop our own website using applications like NotePad++ and Github. Learn to code with 
	  css and html and put them all together into Github.io to create our website.<p>
          
          <p>We are told to watch tutorials on youtube to better help us understand on coding. This web page that you are seeing 
          right now is done all thanks to the youtube tutorials and also with the help of Mr Steven.
		  
          <p>These two videos are the tutorial on youtube. first one on css and the second, on html.<p>
